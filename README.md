# diff

* Fetch and display data from the GitHub API ( https://developer.github.com/v3/ )
* List PRs in the repo. You might want to show only open PRs. 
* When a PR is selected, show the diffs for it. 
* This should be the aggregate diffs of the whole PR, not broken down by commit. 
* The diff should be a side-by-side style, similar to the way XCode displays diffs or the “Split” option on GitHub. 
* Please use native iOS (Objective-C or Swift), not web views, javascript, etc.
